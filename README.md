## Application Idea

The idea of the application is to provide features to help keep track of everyday activities with your dog.
Current goal is to have the following functionalities:
1. Stopwatch to keep track of when activities were last completed. Potential for changing colour when an activity needs to be redone
2. Alarm to remind to do an action at a certain time
3. Counter with symbols to mark how many times an activity has been done in a given day (Ex: how many times the dog was fed).
